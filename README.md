## the-watcher-project

The watcher Project is my first open prject based on arduino which uses nodemcu esp8266 board. Its main function is to watch your place like securoty guard. It composed of motion sensor, temperature & humidity sensor, ultrasonic sensor, RGB light control, and automatic light switch relay.
It can be also access or controlled via mobile app made using Blynk.
